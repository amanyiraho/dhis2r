## Overview

`dhis2r` is an R client for the DHIS2 web API.

Pull data from a DHIS2 instance into R without logging into the DHIS2 user interface.

`dhis2r`, if used with Rmarkdown, quarto, Rshiny, etc., can improve routine reporting and data requests.

### Motivation for this package

[DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/) is an open-source, web-based Health Management Information System (HMIS), and currently being adopted in the education sector as the Education Management Information System (EMIS) in several countries.

More than 73 countries worldwide use DHIS2 for collecting and analyzing health data. 2.4 billion people (30% of the world’s population) live in countries where DHIS2 is used. (source: https://dhis2.org/)

With the increasing number of data managers/analysts downloading data from DHIS2 instances to make **routine period** reports, data visualisation and dashboards, this R package can make it much easier to pull the required data.

There are over 2 million R users, some of whom periodically analyse data from DHIS2; and support health programs which affect over the 2.4 billion people.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dhis2r from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("amanyiraho/dhis2r")
```


## Usage 

### How to connect to a DHIS2?

Users must be authenticated to access a specific DHIS2 instance before connecting to it.

The easiest way to connect to a DHIS2 instance using dhis2r is to use the `username` and `password` of the DHIS2 user.


```{r}
library(dhis2r)
dhis2_play_connection <- Dhis2r$new(base_url = "https://play.dhis2.org/",
                                    username = "admin",
                                    password = "district",
                                    api_version = "2.39.0.1",
                                    api_version_position = "before")
```


`Dhis2r$new()` returns a `Dhis2r` R6 class which represents a DHIS2 connection and can be used to query the DHIS2 instance
 
*No need to log in again when performing other querying tasks.*


### How to pull data from DHIS2

As an example, let's pull Analytics data of `BCG doses given`

Analytics data can include data from indicators, dataElements, program indicators, etc.

```{r}
# dhis2_play_connection$get_analytics(analytic = "s46m5MS0hxu", #BCG doses given
#                                     org_unit = "ImspTQPwCqd", #Sierra Leone (National level)
#                                     period = "202101",
#                                     output_scheme = "NAME" )

```

You can pull data on the following:

- Information about the account
- Access rights information about the account 
- Metadata
- Organisation units
- Analytics
- All possible resources
